//TODO:

!! Make the logic for the finder and of course the ui... actually have no idea rn how to do it, so just google then !!
<!--BUG: For some reason, when Im on the finder page and I try to logout, it says the no named cookie is present but in the browser I can clearly see the auth_token cookie  -->
- !!! Got an idea -> make the hero with some desc of the whole product and have a button there to smoothly scroll down the page to the features section
- Make the frontend stuff for the home page, got the idea so should be fine for most... cannot do it today, just exhausted to the hell, but I must get it done tomorrow
- Make the profile icon, add possible interactions with it, removing the account for start + Show up maybe a modal asking if the user is sure to delete their acccount
- Add the error messages rendering and ofc make the error msgs templates
- Make the whole profile page and data for it, think about it !
- Maybe start working on some desings for the home page

**Make the profile page, that everyone will be able to see**
**Finish the profile dropdown**
**Then the setting of users profile**
**Logic for logging out**
#**Check on youtube and just everywhere how to stop alpine js animations etc from like blinking on the startup / reload of the page/app**#
**Add some user details and user profile data to the profile page and store it in the database maybe under user_id??**

- Look inside the footer, there are other pages for you to make and add !
