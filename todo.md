#TODO:

- !!! error getting the user for the profile: sql: no rows in result set; Got this error when trying to access the profile url page with the username

- Make the profile icon, add possible interactions with it, removing the account for start + Show up maybe a modal asking if the user is sure to delete their acccount
- Add the error messages rendering and ofc make the error msgs templates
- !!! For some reason the profile button out of login form is not visible !
- Make the whole profile page and data for it, think about it !
- Maybe start working on some desings for the home page
