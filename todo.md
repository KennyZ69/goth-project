//TODO:

<!--TODO: Make the chat app for the web, look in gpt for the idea on how to do it -->
    - Recent chats and last message has to be implemented
    - The overflow down from the page of a chat has to be taken care of
    - The sending of two same messages and then not differentiating by the color...

<!--TODO: Check all the paths for compatibility with all kinds of screens and remake the ui depending on that -->



<!-- TODO: Add the error messages rendering and ofc make the error msgs templates -->
    - Make a func that would take the error message and then would just render on the page if theres is an error (but would somehow need to continue afterwards)
    - Also try to work on some CI/CD because lot of times theres is "broken pipe" error
