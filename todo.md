//TODO:

<!--TODO: Make the chat app for the web, look in gpt for the idea on how to do it -->
    <!-- - Implement the possibility to open (create) the chat by clicking on the option in the search bar -->
    - Make it similarly to the chat-try (chat.templ) just to know how it can work on the exact page     you are using and then adjust it by needs


<!--TODO: Check all the paths for compatibility with all kinds of screens and remake the ui depending on that (the ElseProfile is kind of f_ed)-->



<!-- TODO: Add the error messages rendering and ofc make the error msgs templates -->





**Check on youtube and just everywhere how to stop alpine js animations etc from like blinking on the startup / reload of the page/app**#
