<!-- TODO: Add the javascript for filtering the search and rendering and then remove the uneccessary code like templ for results, /search, etc... -->

!! Make the logic for the finder and of course the ui... actually have no idea rn how to do it, so just google then !!
- !!! Got an idea -> make the hero with some desc of the whole product and have a button there to smoothly scroll down the page to the features section
- Add the error messages rendering and ofc make the error msgs templates
- Make the whole profile page and data for it, think about it !

**Make the profile page, that everyone will be able to see**
**Then the setting of users profile**
#**Check on youtube and just everywhere how to stop alpine js animations etc from like blinking on the startup / reload of the page/app**#
**Add some user details and user profile data to the profile page and store it in the database maybe under user_id??**
